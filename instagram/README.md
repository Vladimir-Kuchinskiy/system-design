# Design Instagram

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** views a post 
* **User** views a post and leave a **Like**
* **User** views a post and leave a **Comment**
* **User** views the news feed and can see the timeline of posts of the users he/she follows

* **Service** tracks analytics of pages
    * Monthly visit stats
* **Service** deletes expired pastes
* **Service** has high availability

#### Out of scope

* **User** registers for an account
    * **User** verifies email
* **User** logs in/out into a registered account
    * **User** edits a profile
* **User** can follow/unfollow other **User**
* **User** can upload a **Post**

### Constraints and assumptions

#### State assumptions

* Traffic is not evenly distributed
* Showing **Timeline** should be fast
* **Timeline** should be always available for the user, availability, and partition tolerance are important.
* Eventual consistency for a **Timeline** is okay.
* **Timeline** update should NOT be in real-time, it is okay to have a 1-5 sec delay.
* 10 million users
* 100 million writes per month (10 mil posts + 30 mil comments + 60 mil likes).
* 1000 million (1 milliard) reads per month.
* 10:1 read-to-write ratio

#### Calculate usage

* Size per Post ~ 10 Mb content per post
* Size per Like ~ uint64 + uint64 + timestamp (64+64+12) = 140 bytes ~ 0.14 Kb
* Size per Comment ~ uint64 + uint64 + timestamp + varchar(1024) = 1164 bytes ~ 1.16 Kb
* 10 Mb Post * 10 million posts         = 100 Tb posts per month
* 0.14 Kb Like * 60 million likes       = 8.4 Gb likes per month
* 1.16 Kb Comment * 30 million comments = 34.8 Gb comments per month
* Assume most are new posts instead of updates to existing ones
* 4 post writes per second on average
* 24 like writes per second on average
* 12 comment writes per second on average
* 400 read requests per second on average

## Step 2: Create a high level design

## Step 3: Design core components

### Use case: User enters a block of text and gets a randomly generated link

We could use a [relational database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#relational-database-management-system-rdbms) as a large hash table, mapping the generated url to a file server and path containing the paste file.

Instead of managing a file server, we could use a managed **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 or a [NoSQL document store](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#document-store).

An alternative to a relational database acting as a large hash table, we could use a [NoSQL key-value store](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#key-value-store).  We should discuss the [tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql-or-nosql).  The following discussion uses the relational database approach.

* The **Client** sends a create paste request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)
* The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Write API** server
* The **Write API** server does the following:
    * Generates a unique url
        * Checks if the url is unique by looking at the **SQL Database** for a duplicate
        * If the url is not unique, it generates another url
        * If we supported a custom url, we could use the user-supplied (also check for a duplicate)
    * Saves to the **SQL Database** `pastes` table
    * Saves the paste data to the **Object Store**
    * Returns the url

**Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.

The `pastes` table could have the following structure:

```
shortlink char(7) NOT NULL
expiration_length_in_minutes int NOT NULL
created_at datetime NOT NULL
paste_path varchar(255) NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY(shortlink)
```

Setting the primary key to be based on the `shortlink` column creates an [index](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#use-good-indices) that the database uses to enforce uniqueness. We'll create an additional index on `created_at` to speed up lookups (log-time instead of scanning the entire table) and to keep the data in memory.  Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.<sup><a href=https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know>1</a></sup>

To generate the unique url, we could:

* Take the [**MD5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the user's ip_address + timestamp
    * MD5 is a widely used hashing function that produces a 128-bit hash value
    * MD5 is uniformly distributed
    * Alternatively, we could also take the MD5 hash of randomly-generated data
* [**Base 62**](https://www.kerstner.at/2012/07/shortening-strings-using-base-62-encoding/) encode the MD5 hash
    * Base 62 encodes to `[a-zA-Z0-9]` which works well for urls, eliminating the need for escaping special characters
    * There is only one hash result for the original input and Base 62 is deterministic (no randomness involved)
    * Base 64 is another popular encoding but provides issues for urls because of the additional `+` and `/` characters
    * The following [Base 62 pseudocode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/742013/how-to-code-a-url-shortener) runs in O(k) time where k is the number of digits = 7:

```python
def base_encode(num, base=62):
    digits = []
    while num > 0
      remainder = modulo(num, base)
      digits.push(remainder)
      num = divide(num, base)
    digits = digits.reverse
```

* Take the first 7 characters of the output, which results in 62^7 possible values and should be sufficient to handle our constraint of 360 million shortlinks in 3 years:

```python
url = base_encode(md5(ip_address+timestamp))[:URL_LENGTH]
```

We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#representational-state-transfer-rest):

```
$ curl -X POST --data '{ "expiration_length_in_minutes": "60", \
    "paste_contents": "Hello World!" }' https://pastebin.com/api/v1/paste
```

Response:

```
{
    "shortlink": "foobar"
}
```

For internal communications, we could use [Remote Procedure Calls](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#remote-procedure-call-rpc).

### Use case: User enters a paste's url and views the contents

* The **Client** sends a get paste request to the **Web Server**
* The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server
* The **Read API** server does the following:
    * Checks the **SQL Database** for the generated url
        * If the url is in the **SQL Database**, fetch the paste contents from the **Object Store**
        * Else, return an error message for the user

REST API:

```
$ curl https://pastebin.com/api/v1/paste?shortlink=foobar
```

Response:

```
{
    "paste_contents": "Hello World"
    "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    "expiration_length_in_minutes": "60"
}
```

### Use case: Service tracks analytics of pages

Since realtime analytics are not a requirement, we could simply **MapReduce** the **Web Server** logs to generate hit counts.

**Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.

```python
class HitCounts(MRJob):

    def extract_url(self, line):
        """Extract the generated url from the log line."""
        ...

    def extract_year_month(self, line):
        """Return the year and month portions of the timestamp."""
        ...

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        """Parse each log line, extract and transform relevant lines.

        Emit key value pairs of the form:

        (2016-01, url0), 1
        (2016-01, url0), 1
        (2016-01, url1), 1
        """
        url = self.extract_url(line)
        period = self.extract_year_month(line)
        yield (period, url), 1

    def reducer(self, key, values):
        """Sum values for each key.

        (2016-01, url0), 2
        (2016-01, url1), 1
        """
        yield key, sum(values)
```

### Use case: Service deletes expired pastes

To delete expired pastes, we could just scan the **SQL Database** for all entries whose expiration timestamp are older than the current timestamp.  All expired entries would then be deleted (or  marked as expired) from the table.

## Step 4: Scale the design

> Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4edXG0T.png)

**Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**

State you would do this iteratively: 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat.  See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](../scaling_aws/README.md) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.

It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them.  For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**?  **CDN**?  **Master-Slave Replicas**?  What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?

We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues.  Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.

*To avoid repeating discussions*, refer to the following [system design topics](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#index-of-system-design-topics) for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:

* [DNS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#domain-name-system)
* [CDN](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#content-delivery-network)
* [Load balancer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#load-balancer)
* [Horizontal scaling](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#horizontal-scaling)
* [Web server (reverse proxy)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)
* [API server (application layer)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#application-layer)
* [Cache](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cache)
* [Relational database management system (RDBMS)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#relational-database-management-system-rdbms)
* [SQL write master-slave failover](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#fail-over)
* [Master-slave replication](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#master-slave-replication)
* [Consistency patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#consistency-patterns)
* [Availability patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#availability-patterns)

The **Analytics Database** could use a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.

An **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 12.7 GB of new content per month.

To address the 40 *average* read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content should be handled by the **Memory Cache** instead of the database.  The **Memory Cache** is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes.  The **SQL Read Replicas** should be able to handle the cache misses, as long as the replicas are not bogged down with replicating writes.

4 *average* paste writes per second (with higher at peak) should be do-able for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**.  Otherwise, we'll need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns:

* [Federation](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#federation)
* [Sharding](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sharding)
* [Denormalization](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#denormalization)
* [SQL Tuning](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql-tuning)

We should also consider moving some data to a **NoSQL Database**.
